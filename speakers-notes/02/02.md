The parent component will have a simple todos list that displays what to do in the home.
```javascript
todos: [
    {
        title: 'Bathroom duty for Elna!'
        description: 'Elna needs to go to the loo!'
    },
    {
        title: 'Lets go to the mall, today!'
        description: 'You have 5 meals to buy for next weeks cooking.'
    }
]
```
